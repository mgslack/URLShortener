# URLShortener
Rewritten code of a coding exercise I failed at

Was in a job interview that was going ok, but I wasn't prepared for.  Given a coding exercise to create a method to shorten a URL.  I overthought it significantly.  Started writing a bunch of code to split up the input url and got stuck with exceptions (a logic error in the code created) from a SubString call - then ran out of time.

Moral is, simpiler is better.  Instead of jumping into the code like a quack, should've spent 5 or 10 minutes thinking about the problem.  In about 20 lines of code, have a solution, took me all of 20 minutes to put together (though I did spend a few extra minutes to clean up the project - renaming mainly).  I'm publishing this to show, I can do this, and to be better prepared next time.

In short, not really efficient, but using a Dictionary, create short URLs on the count value of the dictionary - can use anything else you want for the key, but simpiler is better...
